# advocates

The Cosmos Advocates repo tracks doc issues, feature ideas, and other collaborative doc efforts. The Cosmos Advocates people care about developer onboarding of Cosmos technology, documentation efforts, and cross-team coordination. 

## Reporting doc issues 

For general outstanding tasks for docs, create an issue here in cosmos/advocates repo. 

When you identify specific technical errors, create a doc issue in that project repository. See the working [list of docs](./docs_list.md/) for the primary content owners and links to the published documentation and the repo or repos. Technical code maintainers for projects are mandated to update documentation, like [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-documentation). 

For all issues, help us out. Provide helpful details of the doc that requires attention, including:

- topic
- links
- context
- version
- screen shots
- other relevant information

## Issue triage 

As we scale our content teams, issue triage is a fluid process that we're still working out. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for caring.
